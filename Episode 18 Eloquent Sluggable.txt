Updating your Eloquent Models
Your models should use the Sluggable trait, which has an abstract method sluggable() that you need to define. This is where any model-specific configuration is set (see Configuration below for details):

use Cviebrock\EloquentSluggable\Sluggable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;

    /**
     * Return the sluggable configuration array for this model.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function sluggable(): array
    {
        return [
            'slug' => [
                'source' => 'title'
            ]
        ];
    }
}
